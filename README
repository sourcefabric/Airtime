Major features:
 * Web-based remote station management.  Authorized personnel can add
   program material, create playlists and schedule programming all via 
   a web interface.
 * Automation.  Airtime has a scheduler function that enables users to
   set shows with playlists for playback at a date and time of their choosing.
   Playlists can be played back multiple times.
 * Solid, fast playback.  Airtime uses the open source Liquidsoap 
   multimedia framework for clean, reliable, fast playback. 
 * Open, extensible architecture.  Stations are free to extend and alter 
   all parts of the program code.
