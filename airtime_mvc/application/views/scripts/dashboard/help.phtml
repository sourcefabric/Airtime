  <h2>Welcome to Airtime!</h2>
<p>Here's how you can get started using Airtime to automate your broadcasts: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Add your files to the library using the "Add Media" button. You can drag and drop your files to this window too. </li>
    <li>Create a playlist in the Playlist Builder menu using your audio files. </li>
    <li>Create a show by going to "Calendar" in the menu bar, and then clicking the "+ Show" icon. This can be either a one-time or repeating show. Only admins and program managers can add shows.</li>
    <li>Add the playlist to the show by going to your show in the Schedule calendar, left-clicking on it and selecting "Add Content." </li>
    <li>Select your playlist and drag and drop it to the "Items in this show" area.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Then you're good to go!</strong><br />
